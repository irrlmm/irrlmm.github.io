  - title: "Problem statement"
    text:
      - "Independent musicians need a fast, affordable, and trustworthy way to master their tracks, because they often lack the technical skills, time, or budget to work with professional engineers."
      - "However, our previous mastering tool depended on an external partnership that has now failed, leaving users without access to a critical part of their release workflow."
      - "If we don't provide a seamless replacement quickly, we risk losing user trust, dropping revenue, and breaking the core promise of our platform."
